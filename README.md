# Bikesharing in Manhattan

## Overview

Data from New York City's Citi Bike program has been analyzed for trends and conclusions in order to explore the possibility of bringing a similar program to Des Moines, Iowa. Python, Jupyter Notebook and Tableau have all been utilized as tools to clean the data and create visualizations that help interpret the data.

## Results

The results of this analysis are captured in maps, bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps that identify usage and demographics of bikeshare participants (see ["Bikesharing_Tableau"] (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jamie.m.thompson/viz/Bikesharing_Tableau_16481763823950/Story1?publish=yes)).

### Summary

The highly successful bikeshare program in New York City suggests that a similar program would also succeed in Des Moines and other other cities with bikeable passageways. Having information on popular ride times and durations may make it easier to manage the program in smaller cities that may need to limit hours of use in order to maintain the equipment.

Addtional visualizations that could also be produced with the data are a line graph that depicts users' age and a map that shows the most used routes, with some additional data around route conditions.
